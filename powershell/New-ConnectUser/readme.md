# Creating a new connect user via PowerShell

This is a sample Powershell Script to create a new user with just a few parameters.  Example for running the script:

```New-ConnectUser.ps1 -emailAddress "user@domain.com" -firstName "User" -lastName "Doe"```

This script could be used as input to create users from a .csv file or even pulling members of an Active Directory Group.

required variables to update in the script:

```$instanceID = "c2e9dc6f-3f69-40e2-b0ec-f78d0c62bee6"```

You can get the Instance ID value from the end of the arn on the overview page for your instance in the Amazon Connect AWS console.

```$password = "1SuperSecretPassword"```

```$routingProfileId = "c2e9dc6f-3f69-40e2-b0ec-f78d0c612345"```

To find routing profile ID you can run:  Get-ConnRoutingProfileList -InstanceId $instanceID 
That will give you a list of routing profile Arn, Id, and Name values.  Find the one you need.

```$securityProfileId = "c2e9dc6f-3f69-40e2-b0ec-f78d0c654321"```

To find the right security profile ID, it's just like the routing profile one above.
Run Get-ConnSecurityProfileList and find the ID for the one you want.
