        <td>When you request a ride, your driver will see where you've place your pickup location pin. For improved pickups, you can enable sharing your physical GPS location. This helps drivers know if you are coming towards them, or where to look for you if your pin is not in your exact location.</td>

        <td>In accordance with state and federal laws, as well as our policies, service animals are permitted to accompany riders at all times. If you're traveling with a pet that's not a service animal, drivers may choose whether or not to allow the pet in their vehicle.</td>
